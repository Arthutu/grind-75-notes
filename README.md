## Two Sum
[Leet Code Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

#### Solutions
1. **Brute Force**: Iterate through all pairs until the target sum is found.
2. **Hash Table**: Use a hash table to store values as you iterate, achieving an efficient single-loop solution.

#### Brute Force Solution

Uses two loops to check each pair of elements until target is found.

```python
def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]
        return []  # No solution found
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the length of the array, as for each element in the array, the code loops the array again.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`, since there the code only allocates memory to the `n` constant only.
  
#### Hash Table Solution

Store each numberâ€™s index in a hash table, allowing for `O(1)` lookup of the needed complement (target - current number) at each step.

```python
array = [1, 4, 5] # array of numbers
target = 2 # the target value

hash_table = {1: 0, 4: 1, 5: 2} # Keys are the array's items and values are their indexes in the array.
````

The hash table approach reduces the time complexity to `O(n)` by storing each number and its index. For each element, check if the complement (target - current element) exists in the hash table. If so, return indices; otherwise, store the element in the hash table.

```python
def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        missing_values = {}

        for idx, num in enumerate(nums):
            missing = target - num

            if missing in missing_values:
                return [missing_values[missing], idx]

            missing_values[num] = idx
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array.
- Space Complexity: `O(n)`, since in the worst case, the code may insert each element of the array into the hash table, hence the space used by the hash table grows linearly with the number of elements in the array.

## Valid Parentheses
[Leet Code Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/)

#### Solutions:
1. **Stack**: Use a stack to track opening brackets and ensure they are closed in the correct order.

#### [Good To Know ðŸ“š] Stack
[Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) is a data structure following the `first in, last out` (FILO) principle. It supports three main operations:

1. **Push**: Insert an item into the stack.
2. **Peek**: Look at the top item of the stack without removing it.
3. **Pop**: Remove the top item from the stack.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9fbea37-a904-4169-8612-ccd85a2cffc0)

The stack data structure is useful in various scenarios. For example, [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) uses a stack under the hood, and [Depth-First Search (DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) relies on a stack, either explicitly or through recursion.

A stack can be implemented using either an array or a linked list.

- **Array Implementation**: A variable _top_ keeps track of the size (length) of the stack, pointing to the next available slot in the array. The push operation adds an element and increments _top_ (checking for overflow), while the pop operation decrements _top_ (checking for underflow) and returns the removed item. A dynamic array allows the stack to grow or shrink as needed, making it an efficient stack implementation with amortized `O(1)` time complexity for push and pop operations. [Visualize array-based stack](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/StackArray.html).

- **Linked List Implementation**: The stack is represented by the head of the linked list, where pushing and popping occur. This implementation doesn't face overflow (unless memory is exhausted). [Visualize linked list-based stack](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/StackLL.html).

#### Stack Solution

In this approach, we use a set to store valid pairs of parentheses, e.g, `()`, `[]`, and `{}`. For each character in the string:

1. If itâ€™s an opening parenthesis, we push it onto the stack.
2. If itâ€™s a closing parenthesis, we check if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack, when paired with the current character, doesnâ€™t form a valid pair. If either condition is met, the string is invalid, and we return `False`.
3. After iterating through the string, the stack should be empty for the string to be valid.


```python
def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    valid_pairs = {"()", "[]", "{}"}

    for char in s:
        if char in "({[":
            stack.append(char)
        elif not stack or stack.pop() + char not in valid_pairs:
            return False

    return not stack
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`, as we iterate through the string once.
- Space Complexity: `O(n)` in the worst case (when all characters are opening brackets and are pushed onto the stack). The actual space usage depends on the number of unmatched opening brackets, which can vary from O(1) (e.g., empty string or single valid pair) to O(n) (when all characters are a opening bracket).
